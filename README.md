# VBA Challenge Written Analysis
## Overview of Project:
### Background of the Analysis:

In this project, we were given data about some stocks. Our task was to use our knowledge of Visual Basic for Applications using macros, "if" conditions, and "for" loops. We also learned and applied the formatting cells with bold and underline of the header. We showed the results in color coding; the losses were shown in Red and the profits were shown in Green. We also made buttons for the user so they can use the code easily. Deciding which stock to invest was a bit easier with the colors added. We also used refactoring and debugging code. It was challenging to fix the errors, because since VBA does not show what the error is, we need to find and fix it manually. 

### Purpose of the Analysis:

The purpose of this analysis was to make the decision about investing in stocks a bit easier just by looking at the output of the data. We added buttons for selecting the year we needed to analyze. Showing the results in red and green colors made it much easier. We also refactored the code. Below are some advantages and disadvantages of refactoring the code:

#### The advantages of the refactoring are:
* Refactoring saves the time as compared to typing the whole code
* Refactoring makes the code more efficient and reduces the execution time
* We can focus more on making the code more efficient as compared to writing from scratch
* As the time is saved from writing we can use that time to improve the display of the results
#### The disadvantages of the refactoring are:
* It makes it difficult to debug.
* Debugging takes more time to identify the errors from the pre-written code than writing code from scratch.
* While debugging if we create some errors, we consume more time to fix newly introduced errors and have to continue debugging again
* Execution times can go up

### Results:

After refactoring and debugging the code, we can see that the "ENPH" and "RUN" stocks thoughout 2017-2018 were reliable and made profit. This is easier to compare because of color coding, as shown below:

We can also look at the execution times of each code to compare the original code with the refactored code:

Original Code Execution Time (2017):

Refactored Code Execution Time (2017):

Original Code Execution Time (2018):

Refactored Code Execution Time (2018):

![Refactored Code Execution Time (2018)](https://github.com/KJoshi111/stock-analysis/blob/main/run_time_2018.png)

As you can see, the original code's execution time is less than the refactored code's execution, and that is because we added more features, and also debugged, the original code, and that takes more time to run. 


### How the Advantages and Disadvantages Apply to the VBA Script:

The pros and cons above apply to refactoring the original VBA script, because refactoring the VBA script made it more efficient, and we could focus more on making the code more efficiant as compared to typing the whole script. To continue, refactoring the VBA script was very time consuming, debugging was difficult, and the execution times went up significantly.
